# CV Relevancy Ranking System

## Overview

This project aims to build an NLP-based system to rank CVs and individual CV sections based on their relevance to specific job descriptions. The system helps identify the most relevant skills, experiences, and qualifications on a CV, thus automating and streamlining the CV evaluation process.

## Features

- **Point-wise CV Relevance Ranking:** Ranks sections of a CV based on their relevance to a given job description (Skills, Work Experience, Education, Certifications).
- **Overall CV Ranking:** Evaluates and ranks multiple CVs by their overall relevancy to a job description.
- **Fine-tuned NLP Model:** Uses a pre-trained BERT-based model (such as BERT, DistilBERT, SBERT) fine-tuned on job descriptions and CV datasets.
- **Soft Skills Handling:** Detects soft skills (e.g., leadership, teamwork) and ranks them alongside technical skills and experience.
- **Explainable Scores:** Provides explainable scores to understand the rationale behind the ranking of sections or CVs.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CV_Ranker.git
   ```

2. **Set up the Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   cd CV_Ranker
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install the Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

5. **Access the Web Interface:**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the app.

## Usage

1. **Upload CVs and Job Descriptions:**

   - Upload PDF files containing CVs.
   - Enter a job description in the provided text area.

2. **View Ranked CVs and Sections:**

   - The app will rank each CV section (Skills, Work Experience, Education) based on their relevance to the job description.
   - You will see an ordered list of CVs ranked by overall fit.

3. **Output:**

   - The ranked CV scores are saved in a file `cv_score.output` after processing.
   - Scores are based on keyword matching, skill detection, and section relevancy.

## Model Overview

- **Pre-trained Models:** Utilizes BERT-based models like BERT, DistilBERT, or SBERT to extract and rank relevant sections of the CV.
- **Fine-tuning:** The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of job descriptions and CVs to improve its relevancy ranking capabilities.
- **Ranking Criteria:** The system ranks CV sections and CVs based on the job description, focusing on:
  - Skill match
  - Experience relevance
  - Education and certifications
  - Soft skills

## Future Improvements

- **Dynamic Job Description Updates:** If a job description changes, the model should dynamically update the CV rankings.
- **Soft Skill Detection:** More robust detection of soft skills like leadership and communication.
- **Scalability:** Integrate large-scale CV databases or scrape LinkedIn profiles efficiently.
